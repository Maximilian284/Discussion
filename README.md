# Discussion

__Public__ discussion will be held in [the Issues](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion/issues) of this repository. To start a new thread, create a new Issue. Tag your peers using their handle (`@vincenzocoia`, for example) to get their attention.

Lots of the good stuff will end up in [closed Issues](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed), so don't forget to look there! Or, more generally, use the "Search" feature on this repository to find things.

For discussion relevant only to the current run of STAT 545A/547M, see the [Announcements](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-hw-2019-20/Announcements) repository.
